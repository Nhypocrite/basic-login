#### Features 

- **User Registration**: Users can create accounts with a unique username and password.
- **User Login**: Users can log in with valid credentials, and sessions are managed using cookies.
- **"Remember Me" Option**: Sessions can be made persistent with a "Remember me" checkbox.
- **Session Management**: Sessions expire based on whether "Remember me" is selected.

This application provides a simple and secure user authentication flow with session management, ensuring users need to log in to access certain pages.

   - **Not Logged In**: Provides login form; allows "Remember me" option for extended session.
3. Registration Page (`/register`):
   - **Logged In**: Typically redirects to the homepage.
   - **Not Logged In**: Allows new users to register with a unique username.
4. Logout Action (`/logout`):
   - **Logged In**: Logs the user out, clears the session, and redirects to login.
   - **Not Logged In**: Redirects to the login page.



#### Prerequisites

##### 1. Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine

- MariaDB (or MySQL) installed and running
- Git installed

##### 2. Set up the virtual environment (**optional** but recommended)

You can create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv-ass2

# On Windows, run:
.\venv-ass2\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS, run:
source venv-ass/bin/activate

```

##### 3. Install dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### 4. Set up the database

Login to MariaDB/MySQL:

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p

```

â€‹	Create the database and tables:

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]>
MariaDB [(none)]> source ./users.sql;
MariaDB [(none)]>

```

Or, create table manually, see `users.sql`


##### 5. Configure the application

Open the app.py file and update the database connection configuration with your own credentials:

If you are using the default setting of MariaDB ( for example, using WinNMP), there's no need to change it. 

```python
db_config = {
    'user': 'your_username',
    'password': 'your_password',
    'host': 'localhost',
    'database': 'web_programming'
}
```


##### 6. Run the application

You can now start the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the website.
